 ## Introduction
 In this assignment, we apply SVM and RF algorithms to classify images
using features extracted through the SIFT technique. The objective is to eval-
uate the performance of both algorithms on image classification tasks and
compare their effectiveness. We also explore the preprocessing techniques used
to prepare the dataset for classification and evaluate their impact on the
classification results. The results of this study can provide insights into the
effectiveness of SVM and RF algorithms for image classification using SIFT
features and their potential applications in various domains.
